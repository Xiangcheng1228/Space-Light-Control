# Space-Light-Control
It is a simple example about the basis of arduino UNO

#Experimental purposes:

Explore and familiarize yourself with Arduino's digital input and output capabilities and understand their applications.

#Experimental requirements 

Make a prototype of the spacecraft control panel, as shown in Figure 1.

Requirement: The key is not pressed on time, only the green light is on. When the key is pressed, the green light does not light up, the red light of pin 4 flashes at 2 second intervals (on for 2 seconds and off for 2 seconds), and the red light of pin 5 flashes at 1 second intervals (on for 1 second and off for 1 second).

Test Environment:Arduino 2.3.2 on Windows 11 23H2 platform, CPU is Intel Core Ultra 7-155H.
